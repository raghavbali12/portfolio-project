This is a project to publish a portfolio website for myself on the internet (https://raghavbali.com/). The project was completed mainly using Python with Django, and also utilizes some
HTML5 and CSS (courtesy of https://getbootstrap.com/). The project leverages a PostgreSQL database to store information such as blogs, videos and more, and the
Django framework is used to render the correct views to the user.
I used DigitalOcean to host my website.
